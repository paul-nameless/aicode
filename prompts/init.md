Thoroughly assess the codebase and draft an AI.md file that includes:
1. Comprehensive build, lint, and test instructionsâ€”with emphasis on how to execute individual tests.
2. Detailed code style requirements, addressing imports, formatting, type usage, naming patterns, error handling, and related best practices.
Additional guidance:
- This document will be referenced by agentic coding agents (similar to yourself) interacting with the repository. Aim for a length of roughly 20 lines.
- If an AI.md already exists, focus on enhancing its clarity, completeness, and usefulness.
- If the project contains files such as CLAUDE.md, Cursor rules (in .cursor/rules/ or .cursorrules), or Copilot guidelines (in .github/copilot-instructions.md), ensure their relevant rules and conventions are incorporated or summarized as appropriate.
