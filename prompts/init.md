Please analyze this codebase and create a AI.md file containing:
1. Build/lint/test commands - especially for running a single test
2. Code style guidelines including imports, formatting, types, naming conventions, error handling, etc.
Usage notes:
- The file you create will be given to agentic coding agents (such as yourself) that operate in this repository. Make it about 20 lines long.
- If there's already a AI.md, improve it.
- If there are CLAUDE.md, Cursor rules (in .cursor/rules/ or .cursorrules) or Copilot rules (in .github/copilot-instructions.md), make sure to include them
