Reads a file from the local filesystem. The file_path parameter must be a relative path. By default, it reads up to 2000 lines starting from the beginning of the file. You can optionally specify a line offset and limit (especially handy for long files), but it's recommended to read the whole file by not providing these parameters. Any lines longer than 2000 characters will be truncated. For image files, the tool will display the image for you.
